# Task 7.63: Visibility Modifiers Implementation Summary

**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Coverage Impact**: Minimal (maintained existing coverage levels)

## Overview

Successfully implemented full support for visibility modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) in DWScript classes, following Delphi/Object Pascal conventions.

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: AST Updates

**Files Modified:**
- `ast/classes.go` - Added `Visibility` enum type
- `ast/functions.go` - Added `Visibility` field to `FunctionDecl`

**Changes:**
1. Created `Visibility` enum with three levels:
   - `VisibilityPrivate` (0) - Only accessible within the same class
   - `VisibilityProtected` (1) - Accessible within class and descendants
   - `VisibilityPublic` (2) - Accessible from anywhere

2. Updated `FieldDecl.Visibility` from `string` to `Visibility`
3. Added `FunctionDecl.Visibility` field for method visibility
4. Implemented `String()` method for debugging

### Phase 2: Parser Updates

**Files Modified:**
- `parser/classes.go`

**Changes:**
1. Updated `parseClassDeclaration()` to:
   - Track current visibility level while parsing class body
   - Recognize `private`, `protected`, `public` keywords as section markers
   - Default visibility to `VisibilityPublic` (Delphi standard)
   - Support multiple visibility sections in one class

2. Updated `parseFieldDeclaration()` to:
   - Accept `visibility` parameter
   - Set field's visibility from parameter instead of hardcoding "public"

3. Method declarations now inherit current visibility level

### Phase 3: Semantic Analysis

**Files Modified:**
- `types/types.go` - Extended `ClassType` with visibility maps
- `semantic/analyzer.go` - Added visibility checking logic

**Changes:**

1. **ClassType Extensions:**
   - Added `FieldVisibility map[string]int` - tracks field visibility
   - Added `MethodVisibility map[string]int` - tracks method visibility
   - Updated `NewClassType()` to initialize visibility maps

2. **Analyzer Enhancements:**
   - `analyzeClassDecl()` now stores visibility for fields and methods
   - Implemented `checkVisibility()` helper with full visibility logic:
     - Public: always accessible
     - Private: only from same class
     - Protected: from same class and descendants
   - Implemented helper functions:
     - `isDescendantOf()` - checks inheritance relationship
     - `getFieldOwner()` - finds class declaring a field
     - `getMethodOwner()` - finds class declaring a method

3. **Access Control:**
   - `analyzeMemberAccessExpression()` checks field visibility
   - `analyzeMethodCallExpression()` checks method visibility
   - Error messages indicate visibility level and owning class

### Phase 4: Testing

**Files Created:**
- `semantic/visibility_test.go` - 15 comprehensive test cases
- `testdata/visibility_demo.dws` - Example usage

**Test Coverage:**
- Private field/method access from same class ✓
- Private field/method blocked from outside ✓
- Protected field/method access from child class ✓
- Protected field/method blocked from unrelated code ✓
- Public field/method access from anywhere ✓
- Default visibility is public ✓
- Inherited visibility across class hierarchy ✓
- Multiple visibility sections in one class ✓

## DWScript Syntax Support

```delphi
type TExample = class
private
    FPrivateField: Integer;
    procedure PrivateMethod;
protected
    FProtectedField: String;
    function ProtectedMethod: Boolean;
public
    FPublicField: Float;
    constructor Create;
end;
```

## Visibility Rules Implemented

1. **Private Members** (Task 7.63g):
   - ✅ Only accessible within the declaring class
   - ✅ Not inherited by child classes (inaccessible from children)
   - ✅ Error message: "cannot access private field/method 'X' of class 'Y'"

2. **Protected Members** (Task 7.63h):
   - ✅ Accessible within the declaring class
   - ✅ Accessible from all descendant classes
   - ✅ Not accessible from unrelated code
   - ✅ Error message: "cannot access protected field/method 'X' of class 'Y'"

3. **Public Members** (Task 7.63i):
   - ✅ Accessible from anywhere
   - ✅ No restrictions

4. **Default Visibility** (Task 7.63e):
   - ✅ Members without explicit visibility keyword are `public`
   - ✅ Follows Delphi/Object Pascal convention

5. **Self Reference** (Task 7.63l):
   - ✅ Within methods, `Self` can access private members of own class
   - ✅ Implemented via `currentClass` tracking in analyzer

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Visibility Storage

Visibility is stored as `int` in `ClassType` maps to avoid circular dependencies:
- AST defines `Visibility` enum
- Types package doesn't import AST
- Semantic analyzer converts between the two

### Inheritance Handling

The `checkVisibility()` function correctly handles:
- Same class access (private and protected)
- Descendant class access (protected only)
- Unrelated code access (public only)

Uses `isDescendantOf()` to walk inheritance chain.

### Error Reporting

Visibility violation errors include:
- Visibility level (`private`, `protected`)
- Member name
- Owning class name
- Position in source code

Example: `cannot access private field 'FValue' of class 'TExample' at 15:12`

## Files Changed Summary

| File | Lines Changed | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `ast/classes.go` | +44 | Visibility enum and FieldDecl update |
| `ast/functions.go` | +1 | FunctionDecl visibility field |
| `parser/classes.go` | +30 | Visibility section parsing |
| `types/types.go` | +4 | ClassType visibility maps |
| `semantic/analyzer.go` | +100 | Visibility checking logic |
| `semantic/visibility_test.go` | +385 | Test suite (new file) |
| `testdata/visibility_demo.dws` | +45 | Demo file (new file) |
| **Total** | **~609 lines** | **7 files modified/created** |

## Test Files Fixed

- `ast/classes_test.go` - Updated string literals to enum values

## Known Limitations

1. **Method Implementation Outside Class:**
   - Parser doesn't yet support `function TClass.Method: Type; begin ... end;` syntax
   - Methods must be defined inline within class declaration
   - This is a parser limitation, not a visibility issue

2. **Constructor Visibility:**
   - Constructors currently always public
   - DWScript allows private constructors (singleton pattern)
   - Can be added in future enhancement

3. **Property Visibility:**
   - Properties (not yet implemented) will need visibility support
   - Planned for Stage 8
