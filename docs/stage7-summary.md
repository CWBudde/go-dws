# Stage 7 Completion Summary: Object-Oriented Programming

**Completion Date**: January 2025
**Tasks Completed**: 7.1-7.5, 7.13-7.27, 7.28-7.35, 7.36-7.44, 7.61-7.65
**Supersedes**: `docs/stage7-phase*.md`, `docs/task7.*.md`

## 1. Overview

Stage 7 implements a comprehensive, Delphi-style Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) model for the Go-based DWScript interpreter. This includes the entire lifecycle from type definition and parsing to runtime execution and semantic analysis. The implementation provides a robust foundation with classes, inheritance, polymorphism, visibility control, and other advanced features, all backed by extensive testing.

## 2. Core OOP Implementation (Phases 1-4)

The core of the OOP model was built across four foundational phases.

### 2.1. Type System & Runtime Representation (Phases 1 & 3)

A dual system was established to represent classes at compile-time and runtime.

- **`types.ClassType`**: A compile-time representation that defines a class's structure, including its parent, fields, and method signatures. It powers type compatibility checks, such as `IsSubclassOf()` and `ImplementsInterface()`.
- **`interp.ClassInfo`**: A runtime metadata blueprint for each class, shared across all instances.
- **`interp.ObjectInstance`**: The runtime representation of an object, containing its specific field values and a reference to its `ClassInfo`. It implements the `Value` interface, making objects first-class citizens in the interpreter.

### 2.2. Parser (Phase 2)

The parser was extended to understand all standard DWScript class syntax.

**Syntax Examples:**
```pascal
// Class Declaration
type TPoint = class(TObject)
  X, Y: Integer;
  function ToString: String;
end;

// Object Creation & Member Access
var p: TPoint := TPoint.Create();
p.X := 10;
PrintLn(p.ToString());
```

### 2.3. Interpreter (Phase 4)

The interpreter brings the parsed AST and runtime structures to life.

- **Class Registration**: `evalClassDeclaration` processes `type` blocks, building `ClassInfo` metadata and storing it in a registry.
- **Object Instantiation**: `evalNewExpression` handles `TClass.Create()`, creating an `ObjectInstance`, initializing its fields to default values, and executing its constructor.
- **Member Access**: `evalMemberAccess` and `evalMethodCall` handle `object.member` syntax.
- **`Self` Keyword**: Within a method, `Self` is bound to the current `ObjectInstance`, allowing access to its fields and other methods.
- **Polymorphic Dispatch**: Method calls are resolved at runtime by searching the object's actual class hierarchy (`GetMethod`). This provides dynamic dispatch, which is the foundation for `virtual`/`override`.

---

## 3. Advanced Class Features (Phase 5 & Tasks 7.63-7.65)

Building on the core implementation, several advanced features were added to align with modern OOP practices.

### 3.1. Static Members (Static Fields & Methods)

- **`class var`**: Defines a static field shared by all instances of a class. Stored once in `ClassInfo`.
- **`class function`/`procedure`**: Defines a static method that can be called on the class itself (e.g., `TMath.Add(a, b)`). It has no `Self` context and can only access other static members.

**Syntax:**
```pascal
type TCounter = class
  class var Count: Integer;
  class procedure Increment; static;
end;
```

### 3.2. Visibility Control

Access to class members is controlled by `public`, `protected`, and `private` specifiers, enforced by the semantic analyzer.

- **`public`**: Accessible from anywhere (default).
- **`protected`**: Accessible by the class and its descendants.
- **`private`**: Accessible only by the declaring class.

**Syntax:**
```pascal
type TMyClass = class
private
  FSecret: Integer;
protected
  FValue: Integer;
public
  procedure DoSomething;
end;
```

### 3.3. Virtual Polymorphism

True polymorphic behavior is enabled with `virtual` and `override`.

- **`virtual`**: Marks a method as overridable by subclasses.
- **`override`**: Replaces the implementation of a parent's virtual method. The semantic analyzer ensures the signature matches exactly.
- **`abstract`**: When applied to a `virtual` method, it defines an interface without an implementation, which must be overridden in a non-abstract child class.

**Syntax:**
```pascal
type
  TAnimal = class
    function MakeSound: String; virtual;
  end;

  TDog = class(TAnimal)
    function MakeSound: String; override; // Provides new implementation
  end;
```

### 3.4. Abstract Classes

- **`class abstract`**: Defines a class that cannot be instantiated. It serves as a base for other classes and can contain `abstract` methods. The semantic analyzer will error if a non-abstract child fails to implement all inherited abstract methods.

**Syntax:**
```pascal
type TShape = class abstract
  function Area: Float; virtual; abstract;
end;

// Cannot do: var s: TShape := TShape.Create();
```

## 4. Conclusion

Stage 7 delivers a complete and robust object-oriented programming system for DWScript. The implementation covers the full feature set from basic classes and inheritance to advanced concepts like abstract methods and static members. Each feature is supported by the parser, interpreter, and a growing semantic analysis layer, with extensive tests ensuring correctness and adherence to Delphi/Object Pascal semantics. The codebase is now well-prepared for further feature enhancements and optimizations.
