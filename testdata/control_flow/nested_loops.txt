=== Nested Loops Control Flow Tests ===

Test 1: Break only exits innermost loop
Outer loop iterations: 4 (expected 4)
Inner loop total iterations: 12 (expected 12)
PASS: Break only affected innermost loop

Test 2: Continue only affects innermost loop
Total increments: 12 (expected 12)
PASS: Continue only affected innermost loop

Test 3: Triple nested loops with break
Level 1 iterations: 2 (expected 2)
Level 2 iterations: 6 (expected 6)
Level 3 iterations: 12 (expected 12)
PASS: Break in triple nested loop affected only innermost

Test 4: Break and continue combined in nested loops
Total: 12 (expected 12)
PASS: Break and continue worked together correctly

Test 5: Mixed loop types with break/continue
Mixed loops count: 9 (expected 9)
PASS: Break/continue work with mixed loop types
