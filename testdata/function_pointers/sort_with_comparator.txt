Ascending: [-34, -22, -5, 11, 12, 25, 64, 90]
Test 2: Sort with descending comparator
Original: [64, -34, 25, 12, -22, 11, 90, -5]
Descending: [90, 64, 25, 12, 11, -5, -22, -34]
Test 3: Sort by absolute value
Original: [64, -34, 25, 12, -22, 11, 90, -5]
By absolute value: [-5, 11, 12, -22, 25, -34, 64, 90]
