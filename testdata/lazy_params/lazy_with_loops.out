=== Test 1: Lazy expression with global variable ===
Expression: globalCounter * 2
Iteration 1: expr = 2
Iteration 2: expr = 4
Iteration 3: expr = 6
Iteration 4: expr = 8
Iteration 5: expr = 10

=== Test 2: Sum of lazy expressions ===
Sum of globalCounter^2 for 1 to 5: 55
Expected: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55

=== Test 3: Conditional counting with lazy condition ===
Count of even numbers 1-10: 5
Count of numbers divisible by 3 (1-10): 3

=== Test 4: Simple accumulation ===
Sum of globalCounter for 1 to 4: 10
Expected: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

=== Test 5: Nested loops with constant lazy expression ===
Nested loop (3x4) with constant 5: 60
Expected: 3 * 4 * 5 = 60
