# Implementing a JSCodeGen for DWScript in Go (go-dws)

## Understanding DWScript's Original JSCodeGen Conceptually

**DWScript's JS Code Generator** - In the original DWScript (Delphi Web Script) toolchain, JavaScript code generation works by traversing the language's abstract syntax tree (AST) and emitting equivalent JavaScript constructs. Essentially, each DWScript AST node (representing Pascal-like structures such as variables, expressions, loops, classes, etc.) is converted into a fragment of JS code. The code generator likely walks the AST _after_ semantic analysis, mapping Pascal constructs to JavaScript in a straightforward way. For example, a DWScript if statement becomes a JavaScript if statement; a Pascal for loop might translate to a JS for loop; and so on. This approach ensures that the generated JS preserves the original program's logic and flow[\[1\]](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/165543/how-to-write-a-very-basic-compiler#:~:text=expressions%2C%20eliminating%20excessive%20local%20assignments,local%20inefficiencies%20which%20are%20eliminated)[\[2\]](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/165543/how-to-write-a-very-basic-compiler#:~:text=Generate%20code). The original JSCodeGen probably also handled Object Pascal features (like classes and records) by outputting JavaScript functions and prototypes or ES6 classes to represent them. The emphasis is on maintaining correct semantics: the generator would emit any necessary runtime helpers (for instance, for Pascal's high-level features like set operations or RTTI) and manage name-mangling to avoid collisions. Conceptually, DWScript's JS generator acted as a **transpiler** - converting strongly-typed Pascal code into equivalent, runnable JavaScript.

## Architectural Strategies in Go for a Pascal-to-JS Codegen

**Integrating with go-dws** - In the Go-based go-dws project, the JS code generator should be designed as a **component in the compiler pipeline**. After parsing DWScript source into an AST and performing type-checking, the JSCodeGen step can take the validated AST and produce JavaScript source text. A good architectural approach is to implement the code generator as a _visitor_ or _AST walker_: define functions or methods to handle each AST node type (e.g. a function for generating code for TIfStatement, one for TForLoop, one for TFunctionDecl, etc.). The codegen will recurse through the AST, building the output string. This separation keeps the code generator modular - it can be plugged into the compiler pipeline without altering the parser or semantic analyzer.

Within go-dws, you might create a package or module (e.g. codegen/js) that contains this logic. It would likely take the AST plus some context (like symbol tables if needed for info such as variable names, namespaces, etc.) and output a string or file containing JS code. Go's simplicity makes it feasible to do this by hand: you can use a combination of **manual string construction** and small templates for repetitive patterns. Each AST node's visitor will append the appropriate text to an output buffer (for instance, using a strings.Builder for efficiency). The visitor pattern ensures the generator naturally mirrors the AST structure. This strategy is similar to how many compilers work: parse -> AST -> transform -> _code generation_[\[3\]](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/165543/how-to-write-a-very-basic-compiler#:~:text=,see%20also)[\[1\]](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/165543/how-to-write-a-very-basic-compiler#:~:text=expressions%2C%20eliminating%20excessive%20local%20assignments,local%20inefficiencies%20which%20are%20eliminated).

**State & Emitting Code** - The code generator component may maintain state such as the current indentation level (for nicely formatted output), current function or class context (to handle local variables or this references), etc. A practical pattern is to use a struct (e.g. JSCodegen) with methods like emit(str string) to append to the output buffer, and higher-level methods like emitIndent() to manage indentation. As it visits each AST node, it can use these helpers to output well-formatted JavaScript. For example, when visiting a function definition node, the codegen might output a JS function keyword, the function name, parameters, and a { with a newline, then increase indent, output the function body by visiting child nodes, then decrease indent and output the closing }. Organizing the code generator this way makes it easier to integrate into go-dws - you call something like jsCodegen.Generate(ast) after the AST is ready, and get back a string of JS code.

## Generating Readable and Efficient JavaScript

**Readable Output** - One goal is to produce JavaScript that is not only correct but also human-readable (especially useful for debugging or users who want to see the JS). To achieve this, the code generator should output code with proper indentation, spacing, and possibly preserve original identifiers where possible. Using the AST's information, you can emit the same variable and function names in JS as in the DWScript source (adjusted if necessary to avoid JS reserved words). Maintain the logical structure: e.g., keep each DWScript **unit** or module perhaps as a JavaScript IIFE or ES Module (depending on the target environment) so that global variables and functions don't pollute the global scope. If DWScript has classes, a readable approach is to output them as ES6 classes or as constructor functions with prototypes. ES6 class syntax would be very readable (mirroring the class definitions in Pascal), though if you need to support older JS environments, you might use the prototype approach. In either case, try to keep the layout similar to the source (one class -> one class in JS, one method -> one method, etc.). Comments could even be carried over if the AST retains them, though that's optional.

**Efficiency** - Efficiency in the generated JS comes from leveraging JavaScript's capabilities without unnecessary overhead. Since DWScript is strongly-typed but JavaScript is not, many checks can be omitted in the output - you trust the DWScript compiler's type system. For example, you don't need to insert type-checking code in JS for each operation because the DWScript code was already type-validated. This keeps the JS lean. Use efficient JavaScript idioms: e.g., DWScript array or string operations can directly become JavaScript array or string operations. A Pascal-style for-loop that iterates from 1 to N can be output as a standard for(var i = 1; i <= N; i++) loop in JS. Avoid introducing heavy runtime layers - generate **plain, idiomatic JS** where possible. This not only makes it efficient but also readable. In cases where DWScript has high-level constructs with no direct JS equivalent (for instance, set types or maybe Delphi's try/finally for resource management), you may implement minimal helper functions. But these should be as few as possible; most code can translate directly. It can also be beneficial to do simple optimizations during codegen: for example, if the AST indicates a constant expression, the generator can emit the constant's value instead of an expression. However, **avoid premature optimization** - focus on correctness and clarity first[\[4\]](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/165543/how-to-write-a-very-basic-compiler#:~:text=Ignore%20optimization). Once the basic codegen works, you can refine it to produce more optimized JS (e.g., avoiding unnecessary temp variables, merging some operations, etc.).

**Example patterns:** A DWScript if/else becomes a JS if/else block; a DWScript while loop becomes a JS while loop. Boolean expressions and arithmetic translate directly to JS (and, or to &&, ||, etc.). For DWScript strings and dynamic arrays, JavaScript's strings and arrays suffice (since they are dynamic by nature). Object-oriented features: if DWScript supports classes with inheritance, you could emit each class as a JS class. Ensure that methods preserve the correct this context - in ES6 classes this is automatic, in a pre-ES6 prototype approach you'd need to bind the methods to the class prototype. Also, handle Pascal's unit initialization or global block by emitting code that runs when the module is loaded (for example, code at the end of the JS file to initialize global variables or run initialization sections). By following the AST, you naturally generate structured, _readable_ code rather than obfuscated code. In summary, each Pascal construct is mapped to an equivalent JavaScript construct in a relatively one-to-one fashion, which yields clear code. This approach is backed by common compiler design wisdom: "directly translate a language construct to a lightly-parametrized code template"[\[2\]](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/165543/how-to-write-a-very-basic-compiler#:~:text=Generate%20code) - in other words, use straightforward templates for each construct, which results in understandable output.

## Go Tools and Libraries to Aid Code Generation

You can write the JS code generator purely with Go's standard library - no special dependencies are required beyond the go-dws AST structures. Some helpful patterns and libraries include:

- **strings.Builder** - The strings package provides a Builder type which is ideal for efficiently constructing large strings (like whole source files) by appending text. You can keep a strings.Builder in your JSCodegen struct and call Builder.WriteString as you emit code. This avoids excessive string concatenation and is quite efficient.
- **Text Templates** - For repetitive boilerplate or complex code patterns, Go's text/template package can be useful. It allows you to define a template with placeholders and fill in data (like names or expressions) when generating code. For instance, you might have a template for a function: function {{.Name}}({{.Params}}) {\\n{{.Body}}\\n} and supply the name, parameter list, and body text. The Go text/template package is designed for generating text output from templates[\[5\]](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#:~:text=Package%20template%20implements%20data,for%20generating%20textual%20output). Using templates can make the code generator code simpler and more maintainable when dealing with recurring patterns. However, you don't have to template everything - often a mix of direct string writing and a few templates for consistent patterns works well. (The standard library's template system is quite powerful and can be used to generate code just as it generates HTML or other text.)
- **AST manipulation or printing libraries** - If you prefer, you could construct a JavaScript AST using a library and then serialize it to code. This might ensure correct formatting automatically. For example, the now-archived **Otto** project (a JS interpreter in Go) had an AST for JavaScript; theoretically one could build an Otto AST from DWScript and use its printer. However, this is likely unnecessary for go-dws - writing your own generator is straightforward for this purpose. Given that the target (JavaScript) is a high-level language, using templates or manual string assembly is typically sufficient and was indeed suggested as an acceptable approach in compiler construction[\[2\]](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/165543/how-to-write-a-very-basic-compiler#:~:text=Generate%20code). In contrast to targeting machine code, targeting JS means you don't have to manage registers or low-level details - you're outputting structured text.
- **Formatting** - JavaScript beautifiers or linters (external tools) could be run on the output if needed, but if you implement indentation logic in the generator, you can produce nicely formatted code to begin with. For example, keep a global indentLevel integer in your generator and define a helper to output the correct number of tabs/spaces at the start of each line. Every time you enter a block (like after an {), increase the indent level; when leaving, decrease it. This will naturally produce readable formatted code. Since you're writing the codegen in Go, you have full control - you can ensure consistency in formatting (much as gofmt does for Go code, your generator can do for the output JS).

In summary, basic Go tools suffice. Use **data-driven templates or manual string builders** to emit code and trust the Go type system (and the DWScript type system) to keep everything consistent. The standard library's text/template is _explicitly meant for generating textual output_[\[5\]](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#:~:text=Package%20template%20implements%20data,for%20generating%20textual%20output), which includes source code generation use-cases. Many developers also use fmt.Fprintf with an io.Writer (for example, writing to a file) as an alternative - that can integrate with strings.Builder or file writing directly. Pick whichever method makes the codegen logic most clear.

## Prior Art and Examples in Go

Designing a transpiler from a Pascal-like language to JS in Go isn't without precedent. Notably, **GopherJS** is a project that compiles Go code to JavaScript. Its architecture has the Go frontend produce an AST, and then it walks that AST to output JavaScript code. GopherJS handles a different language, but conceptually it shows how a strongly-typed language can be transpiled to JS by mapping types and constructs systematically. You could browse the [GopherJS repository](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) for inspiration on structuring the code generator (it even handles things like scoping, module wrapping, and so on in its output). Another example is **Pas2JS**, the Free Pascal transpiler to JavaScript, which takes Object Pascal code and emits JavaScript. While Pas2JS is written in Pascal, it demonstrates solutions for supporting Delphi-like constructs in JS. These projects illustrate that the pattern is to perform a source-to-source translation with an intermediate AST.

For a Go implementation targeting DWScript, keep things idiomatic to Go. Leverage Go's strength in handling data structures and text. A simple implementation outline could be:

- Define interfaces or structs for AST nodes if not already in go-dws (likely go-dws already has AST node types).
- Implement a GenerateJS(node ASTNode) string function that switches on the node type and calls specific generator functions for each type.
- Those functions produce code by either writing to a builder or returning substrings that get composed.
- Manage scope: possibly keep track of the current scope's variables (to maybe declare them at the top of functions in var declarations for JavaScript, if desired for clarity).
- Assemble the final output: maybe include a header (license or generated file warning) and any necessary support code (e.g., polyfills or helper functions for things like DWScript's Inc/Dec procedures if used - though those can just become ++/-- in JS). Ensure the output is self-contained and integrates with the go-dws runtime expectations.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a JSCodeGen in Go that fits cleanly into go-dws. It will mirror the original DWScript JSCodeGen's _concept_ (translating Pascal AST to JS code), but implemented in idiomatic Go. The result should be a generator that produces correct, efficient JavaScript that is relatively easy to read and debug.
