# go-dws

A port of [DWScript](https://github.com/EricGrange/DWScript) (Delphi Web Script) from Delphi to Go.

## Overview

go-dws is a faithful implementation of the DWScript scripting language in Go, preserving 100% of DWScript's syntax and semantics while leveraging Go's modern language features and ecosystem.

**DWScript** is a full-featured Object Pascal-based scripting language featuring:
- Strong static typing with type inference
- Object-oriented programming (classes, interfaces, inheritance)
- Functions and procedures with nested scopes
- Operator overloading
- Exception handling
- Comprehensive built-in functions
- And much more...

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - This project is under active development. Stage 2 (Parser & Expressions) is complete at 100%.

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the complete implementation roadmap and current progress.

## Installation

**Note:** Not yet ready for installation. This section will be updated when the first working version is released.

```bash
# Future installation (not yet available)
go install github.com/cwbudde/go-dws/cmd/dwscript@latest
```

## Usage

**Note:** Not yet functional. This section shows the planned CLI interface.

```bash
# Run a DWScript file
dwscript run script.dws

# Evaluate an expression
dwscript -e "PrintLn('Hello, World!');"

# Show version
dwscript version
```

## Development Roadmap

The project follows a 10-stage incremental development plan covering ~511 tasks. For detailed progress and task breakdown, see [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## Design Philosophy

1. **100% Language Compatibility**: Preserve all DWScript syntax and semantics
2. **Incremental Development**: Each stage produces testable, working components
3. **Idiomatic Go**: Use Go best practices while honoring the original design
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Mirror DWScript's extensive test suite
5. **Clear Documentation**: Maintain thorough docs for users and contributors

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project is in very early stages.

### Getting Started

1. Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) to understand the implementation roadmap
2. Review the [reference/](reference/) directory for DWScript original source
3. Check open issues for tasks marked "good first issue"
4. Follow Go best practices and write tests for all changes

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cwbudde/go-dws.git
cd go-dws

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests (when available)
go test ./...

# Build CLI (when available)
go build ./cmd/dwscript
```

## Architecture

The compiler/interpreter follows a traditional architecture:

```
Source Code â†’ Lexer â†’ Parser â†’ AST â†’ Semantic Analyzer â†’ Interpreter
                                                            â†“
                                                         Output
```

Future optimizations may include:
- Bytecode compilation for better performance
- JIT compilation (if feasible in Go)
- JavaScript transpilation backend

## License

**To be determined** - Pending review of DWScript's license and agreement with original author.

This project is a port/reimplementation and will respect the original DWScript license.
